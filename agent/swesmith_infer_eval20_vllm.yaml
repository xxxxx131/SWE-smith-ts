      I've uploaded a TypeScript code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following issue:

      <issue>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </issue>

      Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the issue is resolved?
      I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the issue. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
      Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the {{working_dir}} directory to ensure the issue is resolved.
      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
      1. As a first step, find and read code relevant to the issue.
      2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `node <filename.js>` or the repository's test command via bash.
      3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue.
      4. Rerun your reproduction script (or focused tests) and confirm the issue is fixed.
      5. Think about edge cases and make sure your fix handles them as well.
      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
             If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
             If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
             You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.ts`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.
