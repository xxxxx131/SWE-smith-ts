  You are a TypeScript developer and you have been asked to implement a function.

  You will be given the contents of an entire file, with one or more functions defined in it.
  Please implement the function(s) that are missing.
  
  IMPORTANT TypeScript-specific constraints:
  - Do NOT modify the function signature, including the function name, parameters, return types, or docstring if provided.
  - Do NOT change any other code in the file.
  - Do NOT modify any type annotations or interface definitions.
  - You should not use any external libraries that are not already imported.
  - Maintain TypeScript type safety.

  - Do NOT change any other code in the file.
  - Maintain all type annotations.
  
  Format your output as:
